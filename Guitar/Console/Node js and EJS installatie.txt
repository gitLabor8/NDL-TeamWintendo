Make sure the raspberry pi is up to date:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	
Download and install the latest version of Node.js:
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
	
Install it by running:
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	
You can check that the installation was successful and the version of Node.js with:
	node -v
	
	
Since Express and EJS are both packages for Node.js and are included in the package manager provided by Node.js, we can install them as follows:
	npm install express
	npm install ejs
	
If you want to create your web app now, you can use the following commands to create it:
	node_modules/express/bin/express app_name		(where app_name is of course the name of the app)
	cd app_name
	npm install
	
And once you want to run your app:
	node Guitar/Console/Website/views/guitar.ejs
